# Welcome!

Full-time student pursuing my B.S. in Cybersecurity with a profound interest in security operations and related technology.

## Objective

My current goal is to become OCSP certified and start my penetration testing career as a Jr. Penetration Tester.
I am also open to being part of a red team in any organization or enterprise, working with other teams to secure infrastructure and assets. I aim to acquire the skills needed to also do freelance bug bounties in my free time.
